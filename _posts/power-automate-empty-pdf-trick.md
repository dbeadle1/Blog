# The Empty PDF Trick for Power Automate Custom Prompts ðŸ”§

When working with Custom Prompts in Power Automate, you'll likely hit an annoying limitation: every input is treated as mandatory, even if they are optional inputs for your flow. This post walks through a neat little workaround for handling optional file inputs in a platform that just won't take "no file" for an answer.

### What Are Custom Prompts? *(Skip this if you're already using them)*

Custom prompts let you plug GPT-powered AI into your Power Automate flows. They're a way to feed in your own instructions and get useful, structured outputâ€”like summaries, rewrites, or extracted insightsâ€”based on text or files you provide.

You define what kind of input the AI should expect (like text, a file, or both), and write a prompt that tells it what to do: summarise, analyse, extract info, rewrite, you name it.

They are part of AI Builder and a powerful way to add intelligence to your automations, once you work around the quirks.

More on custom prompts here: [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ai-builder/use-a-custom-prompt-in-flow).

## The Challenge: Mandatory File Inputs

Let's say you've got a custom prompt that takes two inputs: a text description and a file to analyze. Sometimes there's no file, and you'd expect the flow to just handle it. But nope, if that file input is empty, you'll get slapped with a bad request error:

You might try passing `null`, an empty string, or even a `.txt` file. No dice. It has to be a PDF.

## The Fix: The Empty PDF Trick ðŸ’¡

So here's the workaround: give it what it wants. A PDF. A completely empty one.

Here's the world's smallest valid PDF:

```plaintext
%PDF-1.1
1 0 obj
<< /Type /Catalog /Pages 2 0 R >>
endobj
2 0 obj
<< /Type /Pages /Count 0 >>
endobj
xref
0 3
0000000000 65535 f 
0000000010 00000 n 
0000000053 00000 n 
trailer
<< /Root 1 0 R /Size 3 >>
startxref
87
%%EOF
```

It ticks all the PDF boxes and adds practically zero overhead to your flow.

## Implementation Steps

Here's how to build this into your flow:

### 1. Set Up Conditional Logic  
Start with your preferred trigger (manual, automated, whatever fits).

### 2. Create the Empty PDF Variable  
Add a Compose step called 'Compose_empty_pdf'. Paste in the PDF code above as its value.

### 3. Conditional File Handling  
Check if a file was provided:

- If yes: use the uploaded file

- If no: use your empty PDF (from either a Compose step or a string variable)

Example expression:

```plaintext
if(
  equals(triggerBody()?['file'], null),
  outputs('Compose_empty_pdf'),
  triggerBody()?['file']?['contentBytes']
)
```

You can use a Compose action to hold the minimal PDF string, or store it in a string variable if you prefer. Either approach worksâ€”just keep it consistent and easy to maintain.

## Why This Works

Power Automate just wants:  
- A file that starts with `%PDF`  
- Something that looks like a PDF structure

This empty file passes the check. It's tiny, valid, and doesn't interfere with your flow downstream.

## Where This Trick Shines

Some great use cases:

- **Document Review Workflows**: Sometimes you have supporting docs, sometimes you don't  
- **Form Submissions**: Not every form needs an attachment  
- **Approvals**: Requirements vary by case. This lets you keep one flexible flow instead of splitting things up

You save yourself the pain of managing multiple flows or complex branching.

## Best Practices

- **Name things clearly**: Call your variable something obvious like `EmptyPDFForMissingFiles`  
- **Comment your steps**: Future you (or a teammate) will thank you  
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Wrap your custom prompt in error handling for when something does go wrong

## What Didn't Work

Other things we tried:

- **Separate Flows**: Adds maintenance overhead  
- **Multiple Custom Prompts**: More actions = more complexity  
- **Other file types**: Doesn't fly. Power Automate still wants a PDF

## Final Thoughts

This isn't a glamorous solution, but it works. The empty PDF trick helps you sidestep one of the more rigid aspects of Power Automate's custom prompts. When the system demands a file, give it a fake one and move on with your life.

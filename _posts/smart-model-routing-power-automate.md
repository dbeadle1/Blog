# Smart Model Routing in Power Automate: Using GPT-4o-mini as a Gatekeeper for Cost-Efficient Data Analysis ðŸ”§

In this post, I'm sharing a pattern that combines speed, cost-efficiency, and precision when using OpenAI models in Power Automate. The solution routes user questions through a lightweight GPT-4o-mini model before escalating to GPT-4.1 only when deeper data analysis is required. It's ideal for scenarios where you want to preserve compute costs while still offering rich, contextual AI responses when appropriate.

## The Use Case
You're building a solution where users submit natural language questions via Power Apps. These questions might relate to structured datasetsâ€”or they might not. You want to:

- Respond quickly and cheaply to general, non-data questions.
- Route data-intensive queries to a more powerful model that can handle large, structured inputs.

## The Pattern
This setup uses two OpenAI models within a Power Automate flow:

1. **GPT-4o-mini** is used as a classifier.
2. **GPT-4.1** is only triggered when the query is classified as data-related.

Here's how the flow looks in Power Automate:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### 1. **Power Apps Trigger**
The flow starts when Power Apps sends a question.

#### 2. **Initialize Response Variable**
`varResponse` is initialized to hold the AI response.

#### 3. **Call GPT-4o-mini (Classification Only)**
The system message for GPT-4o-mini instructs it to:
- Reply with `DATA` if the question clearly involves data (which GPT-4o-mini isn't expected to handle).
- Respond normally (using HTML) only if the question does not involve data.

This makes GPT-4o-mini a lightweight classifier and first responder.

#### 4. **Condition Check**
If GPT-4o-mini returns the word `DATA`, the flow continues to the GPT-4.1 path.

#### 5. **Call GPT-4.1 (Advanced Analysis)**
The system message for GPT-4.1 sets it up as an advanced qualitative data analyst. It:
- Processes the entire dataset (provided via dynamic input).
- Answers concisely, using HTML formatting only.
- Avoids Markdown and ensures full data review with high accuracy.

Temperature and `top_p` are both set to 1 for deterministic output, and the token limit is maxed at 64,000 to support large datasets.

#### 6. **Store and Return the Response**
Whichever model generates the final output (GPT-4o-mini or GPT-4.1), the response is stored in `varResponse` and returned to Power Apps.

## Benefits
- **Efficiency:** GPT-4o-mini filters out non-data queries quickly and cheaply.
- **Scalability:** GPT-4.1 is only used when truly needed.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each model is tasked with what it does bestâ€”classification vs. in-depth analysis.

## Final Thoughts
This routing approach gives you the best of both worlds: speed and cost-efficiency from GPT-4o-mini, and powerful data analysis from GPT-4.1 when required. It's a scalable pattern worth using if you're building Power Platform solutions that combine structured data with natural language interaction.
